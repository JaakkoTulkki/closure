From MDN

"A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
 with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
 In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer 
 functionâ€™s scope from an inner function."
 
Maybe more clearly: a function that remembers outer variables. 
`;

function foo(x) {
  let c = 0;
  function bar() {
    c += x;
    return c;
  }
  return bar;
}

const fizz = foo(2);
const buzz = foo(5);

console.log(fizz());
console.log(fizz());
console.log(fizz());

// console.log(buzz());
// console.log(buzz());
// console.log(buzz());

// console.log(fizz === buzz);
// console.log(fizz === fizz);
// console.log(buzz === buzz);

`
Thus, returned functions have "memory".
The functions seem to remember what was on the outer scope.

How do they do it?
Functions in JS are also objects (Function object).
They have an internal property called [[Scope]]
